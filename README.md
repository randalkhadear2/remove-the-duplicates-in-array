# remove-the-duplicates-in-array
Given an array of integers nums sorted in ascending order, write the code to to achieve this: 
remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.(code required)

Example

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,5] Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,5,_,_,_,_,_,_,_]
